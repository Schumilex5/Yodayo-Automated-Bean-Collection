# Claim your beans with automation

## Just run the 'main.exe' file in the app folder, give it a txt file that has your email/password combos, in a manner like this:

```
example_email@gmail.com
 PAssWord
 
 example@gmail.com
 password
 ```

## The program will go through all of them and claim the beans for you.
