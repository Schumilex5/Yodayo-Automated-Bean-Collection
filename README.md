#### If your browser is very slow (or your pc / internet) and the pages are taking a long time to load, consider going into the utyl.py file in the app folder, and change the 'plus_waiting_time_you_want' variable to a bigger number, as much as needed for your pages to load, this number is in seconds. This variable is in the 'wait' function at line 53 in the utyl.py file.

##### Heyo, I am new to programming and poython is something I only have basic knowledge of so this code could definetly be better, but it works and that's what matters. I discovered yodayo some time ago I think it's a fair site that gives a secent amount of points, but there were no auto currency claiming programs on github like 'pixai' which is a nice site as well for AI image generation, so I decided to make one. I looked into selenium 2 days ago, and managed to come up with this. I may try to improve this later with a GUI and make it more  user friendly but for starters this is all. Also my markdown looks horrid as well :( have a nice day :)
