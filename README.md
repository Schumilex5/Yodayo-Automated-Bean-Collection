# Claim your beans with automation

## Download the latest release from 
https://github.com/Schumilex5/Yodayo-Automated-Bean-Collection/releases
## give it a txt file that has your email/password combos, in a manner like this: 


```
example_email@gmail.com
PAssWord
 
example@gmail.com
password
```

## The program will go through all of them and claim the beans for you.
# OR
## fill up the users by adding the users manually. The program will create a data.txt file in the folder it's located in. This will contain all the data you provided it with, inluding the manually added users as well as the ones from the txt file you provided and read everything in it at startup, ensuring you don't have to add all these things again.
